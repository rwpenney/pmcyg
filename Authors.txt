Thanks are also due to the following people who have been
very helpful in testing and improving pmcyg:
    Da-Breegster        (improvements to baseline package lists)
    Steve Etchelecu     (finding issue with _rebaseall in replica listing)
    Michael Hanselmann  (patches to support SHA512 checksums etc.)
    Pawel Jasinski      (finding issue with --generate-replica option)
    Ken Poole           (testing of utf-8 support)
    Richie B2B          (patching to support pip-23.1)
    John Windle         (use of 'cygcheck' for mirroring existing installation)
